# r.avaflow

This package hosts a Docker image of the landslide runout modelling software [r.avaflow](https://www.landslidemodels.org/r.avaflow/) developed by [Martin Mergili](mailtoi:martin.mergili@uni-graz.at).

r.avaflow has a complex installation, which can be a steep learning curve for non-proficient users. Therefore, this Docker image provides a barrier-free access to running simulations with r.avaflow. 



```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/yildizanil/ravaflow4g
```
